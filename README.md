Free Open-Source Scribe code repository.

The end goal of this project is to develop a free and open-source program for the creation and management of tabletop RPG character sheets with a system that will enable users to design their own character sheet templates for different RPGs and share them freely. Here is a very basic timeline:

Initial Build: Character Sheet Creation and Management for "Brave", a Knave offshoot: [link here]

Next Build: Character Sheet Creation and Management for common tabletop RPGs (Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder)

Final Build: System for designing character sheet templates for any tabletop RPGs not yet covered

This project is not yet started.
